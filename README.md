1.Hunt Graphs.ipynb  -- Makes Hunt Graphs, specifically
  1. Takes a big chunk of SS tweets and hydrates them w/ Twitter API
  2. Calulates some user stats and selects on these stats to find a subset of the users
  3. Collects the last 200 (?) tweets for those users from the Twitter API
  4. Uses those 200 tweets to create series of  timing/client graphs, which are saved as big pictures.
